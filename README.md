## React Concepts Used

Components: The To-do list application is built with React components, including the main App component and the TodoItem component.

State: The application uses state to keep track of the list of tasks and whether they are completed or not.

Props: The TodoItem component receives props from the App component, including the task name, completion status, and a function to toggle the task's completion.

Event handling: The application uses event handlers to add new tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed.
Conditional rendering: The application conditionally renders components based on whether a task is completed or not.

Hooks Used: useState, useEffect ,Custom Hook
## Features

Basic features-

Adding new tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list

Viewing the list of tasks: Users can view the list of tasks that they have added

Marking tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox or another type of indicator. 

Deleting tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking a delete button or icon. 

Persistence: The list of tasks should be persisted between sessions, so that users can come back to the application later and see their previously added tasks. This could be achieved with local storage.

Accessibility: The application should be accessible to users with disabilities, such as by using appropriate semantic HTML and providing alternative text for images.

## Additional features
Editing tasks: Users can edit the task name or other details of a task, in case they made a mistake or need to update the task.

Sorting and filtering: Users can sort the list of tasks by various criteria, such as due date or priority. Users can also filter the list of tasks to show only completed tasks, only incomplete tasks, or tasks with a specific tag or label.
